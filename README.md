# API Development with Flask - Origins
My goal with this project was to learn web app development. Instead of taking a coursework on the relevant tools, I implemented a personal 
project using Flask. All material that I needed was found online. 

I have no background in web apps so I just searched online videos, articles etc. to gain knowledge and applied to the project.

Below I will list all my references and also mention why I read those articles. 

Secondary goals: 
- Learn how to deploy the project online for use over the web. 
- Work with continuous integration, and learn how to use Github actions.
- REST API design
- Practice TDD
